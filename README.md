# mobile-automation-wdio-bdd-appium
This automation framework uses WebdriverIO (WDIO) for running tests, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with tools like Cucumber for writing test scenarios in plain language, and Appium for automating mobile applications on iOS and Android. All of this runs in a Node.js environment, providing a powerful setup for mobile app testing.
